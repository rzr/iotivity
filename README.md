## Quick guide: build and run IoTivity projects on Ubuntu

 1. Build
	
	  Go to the top directory of `iotivity` project (Note: should always run `scons`
    command in this directory)

    Install external libraries:
    
        $ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev libexpat1-dev libboost-thread-dev

    Build release binaries:
    
        $ scons

    (Note: C++ sdk requires cereal. Please follow the instruction in the build
    message to install cereal)

    Build debug binaries:
    
        $scons RELEASE=false

    Help:
    
        $ scons -h

    Clear:
    
        $ scons -c

 2. Run the samples
 
        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<iotivity>/out/linux/x86_64/release
      
    Run the c++ samples in `<iotivity>/out/linux/x86_64/release/resource/examples`
      
    Run the c samples in `<iotivity>/out/linux/x86_64/release/resource/csdk/stack/samples/linux/SimpleClientServer`
      
    (`<iotivity>` is the path to `iotivity` project. If your device is x86, arm,
    or arm64, please change `x86_64` to the proper arch)

## How to build IoTivity projects

IoTivity includes a series of projects. You can find all these projects here:
    https://gerrit.iotivity.org/gerrit/#/admin/projects/

You can build IoTivity project on Linux / Windows / MAC OSX for various OS 
(Linux, Tizen, Android, Arduino, Windows, MAC OSX, IOS ...).

The output of the build is in:
  `<top directory of the project>/out/<target_os>/<target_arch>/<build_type>/`
e.g.
	`oic-resource/out/android/armeabi-v7a/release/`.

This document takes `iotivity` project as example, the way to build other
projects is almost the same.

### IoTivity project build tool scons

Scons is a cross-platform build tool, its usage is quite similar to GNU make.

To build a project, you just require to run following command at the directory
where a SConstruct file exists (SConstruct is the entrance of scons build, it's
equivalent to Makefile of `make`):

    $ scons [options] [target]

In additional, usually the scons build script of a project provides useful help
information(include build options). To see the help information:

    $ scons [options] -h

Note: If no value is specified for an option, the default value will be used.
The change of options value may impact the output.

### Prerequites

1. Scons

  Please refer to the following page to install scons:
   http://www.scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user.html#chap-build-install
  (Note: on Windows, install Python 2.x before installing scons)

2. IDE/SDK Prerequites

  To build for some OS (Android / Arduino / IOS ...), an IDE/SDK may be required,
  please go to the relative page to download and install the required IDE/SDK.

  Android:

  To build for Android, Andorid NDK and SDK are required.
  
  Android NDK: http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html
  
  Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
  
  (Note: as in some IoTivity projects, C++11 features are used, recommend Android
  NDK >= r10, according to our test result r10c is the best one currently)

  Arduino:

  To build for Arduino, Arduino IDE is required.
  
  Arduino IDE: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
  
  (Note: recommend install Arduino IDE >=1.5.7)

  Arduino builds are dependent on latest Time library. Download it from here:
    http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Time.html
  and extract to `<arduino_ide_root>/libraries/`

  (Note: If you are using Arduino IDE 1.5.8 BETA on Windows, it may pop up some
  dll isn't found. please copy relative dll from the IDE directory to
  C:\Windows\SysWOW64. IDE 1.5.7 doesn't have this issue. Other version IDE isn't
  tested.)

  Apple:
  
  To build for Mac OSX or IOS, Xcode is required.
  
  Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/

  Java:
  
  To build the Java code, JDK is required.
  
  JDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
  
  (If the project doesn't include Java code or you wouldn't like build the
  Java codes, this isn't required)

  (Note: for convenience, suggest add the IDE/SDK path in environment variable,
  so you don't need to add it in command line each time. The build script will
  guide you to do that.)

3. External libraries

  For Android and IOS build, most of the external libraries are provided as
  binary in oic-utilities project (https://oic-review.01.org/gerrit/oic-utilities).
  Please download it in the same directory as other IoTivity projects. If it's
  in different directory, an additional option (OIC_UITLS) will be required. The
  build command should be:
  
      $ scons OIC_UITLS=<path to oic-utilities> [other options] [target]

  (Note: for convenience, you can also add it in environment variable. So you
  don't need to add this option in command line each time.)

  e.g.:
  
      $ export OIC_UITLS=<path to oic-utilities project>

### Build IoTivity project on Linux (Ubuntu) ###

Generally, it's required to specify the target OS and target ARCH, that's to say
tell Scons which OS and which ARCH you'd like build this project for. By default,
the target OS and ARCH is the same as the host.

Some more options may be required, please care the `error` notification when build.
For help about how to set an option, please run:

	$ scons TARGET_OS=xxx TARGET_ARCH=yyy [XXX=zzz ...] -h

1. Build IoTivity project for Linux

        $ cd <top directory of the project>
        $ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev libexpat1-dev libboost-thread-dev
        $ scons

2. Build IoTivity project for Android

        $ cd <top directory of the project>
        $ scons TARGET_OS=android TARGET_ARCH=xxx
      
  (xxx can be x86, armeabi, armeabi-v7a, armeabi-v7a-hard. To see all of its
  allowed value, please execute command `scons TARGET_OS=android -Q -h`)
  
  Note: Currently as x86_64/arm64_v8a external library binaries aren't provided,
  you may meet link problem if build executable binary which depends on external
  library for x86_64/arm64_v8a.

3. Build IoTivity project for Arduino

        $ cd <top directory of the project>
        $ scons TARGET_OS=arduino TARGET_ARCH=xxx BOARD=yyy
      
  (xxx can be avr, arm; yyy is the name of the board, to get its allowed value
  run: scons TARGET_OS=arduino TARGET_ARCH=xxx -h. You may see a option `CPU` in
  the output of above command line, that's due to some boards have different
  processors, to specify the processor, add `CPU=zzz` in the command line. If no
  `CPU` option exists, that means the board only support one kind of processor,
  it's unnecessary to specify it)

4. Build Iotivity project for Tizen

        $ cd <top directory of the project>
        $ gbs build -A xxx --packaging-dir tools/tizen/
      
  (xxx can be i586 or armv7l, we provide the spec file required by gbs tool at
  toools/tizen directory. gbs is default build tool for Tizen platfrom, we can
  refer the following wiki to setup Tizen development environment:
  https://source.tizen.org/documentation/developer-guide/getting-started-guide)

### Build IoTivity project on Windows

1. Build IoTivity project for Android (It's the same as on Ubuntu)

        $ cd <top directory of the project>
        $ scons TARGET_OS=android TARGET_ARCH=xxx
      
  (xxx can be x86, armeabi, armeabi-v7a, armeabi-v7a-hard ...)

2. Build IoTivity project for Arduino (It's the same as on Ubuntu)

        $ cd <top directory of the project>
        $ scons TARGET_OS=arduino TARGET_ARCH=xxx BOARD=yyy
      
  (xxx can be avr, arm; yyy is the name of the board, to get its allowed value
  run: scons TARGET_OS=arduino TARGET_ARCH=xxx -h. You may see a option `CPU` in
  the output of above command line, that's due to some boards have different
  processor, to specify the processor, add `CPU=zzz` in the command line. If no
  `CPU` option exists, that means the board only support one kind of processor,
  it's unnecessary to specify it)

  Note: Currently most IoTivity project doesn't support Windows, so you can't set
  TARGET_OS to `windows` except the project support Windows.

  That's to say if the project doesn't support Windows, run:
  
      $ scons TARGET_OS=windows ....
        
  or run on Windows
  
      $ scons
        
  may always fail.

### Build IoTivity project on Mac OSX

1. Build IoTivity project for Mac OSX

        $ cd <top directory of the project>
        $ scons SYS_VERSION=yyy
      
  (yyy is the OSX version, e.g. 10.9)

2. Build IoTivity project for Android (It's the same as on Ubuntu)

        $ cd <top directory of the project>
        $ scons TARGET_OS=android TARGET_ARCH=xxx
      
  (xxx can be x86, armeabi, armeabi-v7a, armeabi-v7a-hard)

3. Build IoTivity project for IOS

        $ cd <top directory of the project>
        $ scons TARGET_OS=ios TARGET_ARCH=xxx SYS_VERSION=yyy
      
  (xxx can be i386, x86_64, armv7, armv7s, arm64, yyy is IOS version, e.g. 7.0)
  
  Note:
  
  1) for convenience, a script (auto_build.sh) is provided to run possible build
  at once. Following is the usage:
  
  To build:
  
      $ auto_build.sh <path-to-android-ndk> <path-to-arduino-home>
       
  To clean:
  
      $ auto_build.sh -c
  
  2) For Arduino build, the Time library should >=1.3. The old can only be built
  with Arduino IDE 1.0.x
